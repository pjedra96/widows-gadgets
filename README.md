# windows-gadgets
The following project contains working windows 7 sidebar gadgets with their working web browser equivalents: crypto_price gadget and weather gadget. The folders with .gadget in their name, are the actual gadgets, which are supposed to be put inside the Windows Sidebar/Gadgets directory on the C drive, in order to be detected by the windows sidebar program. The both folders also contain an additional folder each, which are their web_browser apps that can be tested in the browser. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository (https://www.github.com/pjedra96/windows-gadgets) to a directory of your choice.
