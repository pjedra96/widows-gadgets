The following project contains two working windows 7 sidebar gadgets with their working web browser equivalents: crypto_price gadget and weather gadget. The folders with .gadget in their name, are the actual gadgets, which are supposed to be put inside the Windows Sidebar/Gadgets directory on the C drive, in order to be detected by the windows sidebar program. The both folders also contain an additional folder each, which are their web_browser apps that can be tested in the browser.
